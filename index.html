        Comp Sci has given me many difficult assignments to start but this might
        take the cake. I have never had so much trouble trying to start an assignment.
        It seems at every step of the way no matter what I try something does not work.
        This is maddening and I fear I will never get it.

        Today we met our groups and talked about "Chocolate Covered Broccoli". I think that this is 
        a really easy trap to fall into when creating an educational game as, when the goal is to educate 
        moreso than create a fun game, it can tend to rely on weak mechanics to make the learning fun. The 
        easiest way to avoid this is by making a game in which the gameplay is tied to the learning 
        but not dependent on it. This helps to avoid overly simple games and to make the game fun before 
        focusing too much on the learning aspect.
        <br><br>
        We later discussed whether or not certain games were chocolate covered broccoli. Our game was 
        Typing of the Dead which is more or less a typing simulator with zombies in it. We collectively
        decided that this game was chocolate covered broccoli because the core mechanic was typing. That 
        said it looked like a fantastic game and I would play it.        
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 7: Game Learning Objectives and MDA Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Here we detail the elements we want to include in our game. We want to include the basic mechanics of flying, collecting
        pollen, and upgrades. We will also be attempting to include a day and night cycle in which you forage during
        the day and defend at night. I think that this will be a simple and fun game design that wont take too 
        long so it would make a good educational game.
        <br><br>
        The learning objectives of this game are to teach kids about bees and 
        their importance in the ecosystem as primary pollinators. I hope to show the player the importance 
        of protecting our bees because they, along with a few other animals, hold up the foodchain.
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 8: Formal Elements of Games</h4>
      <p>
        This was a homework kind of similar to the MDA assignment where we read a paper
        about elements of game design. In this one we were tasked with analyzing all of the 
        "Formal Elements" of some games. Most game's primary elements can be categorized, so if you stick to a game
        and categorize every element, it will paint a very specific picture of that game.
        Using this paper, we categorized each the aspects of a few games.

      <h4>Class: Feb 22</h4>
      <p>
        Today we talked about how to affect change on the players of our games. Despite what it may sound like,
        I actually consider myself to have great opinions on all things and to be fairly left
        leaning. I do not fully agree with the methods to affect change proposed in class today. There is a line close
        to the beginning of the powerpoint about educating kids on how they can affect positive change. I do not
        think that educating kids how they can affect change is a way that they can actually affect change. I 
        fear that it runs the risk of turning that kid into an annoying little propaganda bot for whatever it is 
        you are telling them but more likely it just makes the kid bored. I think that for certain issues, a more effective 
        approach is simply educating kids on the issues and allowing them to decide whether or not to care about it on their own
        is the most effective way to affect change. Realistically, these kids are not gonna make any type of good change
        until they are all grown up and taking over the world. I think this has been proven to be true by children taking the 
        stage such as Greta Thunberg. I agree completely with what she is saying, but sadly, because she is a child, she is 
        simply incapable of reaching those that disagree with her because an adult that doesn't believe in climate change isn't 
        gonna be like maybe I am wrong because this kid disagrees with me. These kids are the future and they will be able
        to affect enormous change when their time comes.
        <br><br>
        This in mind, I think that the most effective way to affect this change is to instill importance in specific 
        issues that kids like and then show how the world is going to affect these issues. This will make the kid go 
        home and internalize these issues so that they can potentially take up an interest in them that will stick with 
        them their whole life. Then you have an educated adult down the line rather than a kid that simply gets told to 
        stop spouting off whatever the recent issue their school made them learn about. I have republican parents so I should 
        know. As a kid coming home and being like "today at school I learned about climate change" and watching their reactions
        did have an affect on me, and I adopted their policies over my school's because I trust my parents way more than my teachers
        (no offense professor judging from the slide's desire to create change I probably agree with you much more than them now).
        I think this is the case often and so, in an effort to avoid providing nothing but hollow phrases to be shot down at home, 
        I think we should try to instill a true interest in a subject and let that blossom into advocism down the line.
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 5: Individual Pitch for Game Idea</h4>
      <p>
        I chose to make my pitch about a possible game surrounding the importance of bees in the ecosystem. A few years
        back there was a whole lot of news about the dwindling population of Honeybees which, if it ever returned as a
        true threat regarding their extinction, would spell a potential end of agriculture as we know it. We would figure
        something out as the most adaptable species on the planet, but isn't it better to just protect the resources we 
        have been provided by Nature. Mainly this game would be a little 2D platformer flying simulator in which you 
        fly around to flowers and pollinate them showing the fruits of your labor as you progress the game with more 
        flowers blooming as time moves on.I think that this could be both a very fun game and an avenue for instilling
        an interest in nature and providing a potential future reality in which the bees die out if nothing is done about it.
      </p>

      <h4>Class: Feb 24</h4>
      <p>
        Today I gave my pitch and listened to my classmates pitch. Given my stage fright, I did not paint the most effective 
        picture about the pros of my game but I think I did a good enough job to rally some support for my idea. I also think 
        that my classmates appreciate that my game could end up being quite fun if done correctly. Not to brag but my game 
        pitch did make the cut and I will be making it and I am very proud of that.
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 6: Getting to know and practice TypeScript</h4>
      <p>
        This was the first real coding assignment of the class and its good to be playing around with code with videogames 
        in mind. This assignment did a good job of showing the potential avenues I could take to create a game with 
        mechanics that are both fun and effective at conveying my message. I really enjoyed this, especially the spaceship
        problems as I think that they did a good job of illustrating how elements of the game could interact with eachother.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 2</h3>
      <h4>Class: Feb 15</h4>
      <p>
        Today we reviewed the kid's interviews and tried to compile a document which effectively summarized
        what their likes and dislikes were in general about videogames. We decided that kids like games with
        building in them because it can be a creative outlet and it is also just fun to create stuff. They also
        seemed to like games where you can kill. We also talked about what the kids thought they were 
        learing from their favorite games. The main things were problem solving which I agree with and honing
        their math skills counting blocks and stuff in Minecraft.
        <br><br>
        In addition we talked about what aspects were important to make educational games fun for the
        target audience. The biggest things we settled on was a lack of luck, progression, variety, and creativity.
        Also we must try to make the game as un-babyish as possible while still being simple enough to
        appeal to young kids. Also no preaching because then it's not a game its a crappy reading simulator.
        <br><br>
        Afterwards we talked about inclusion and diversity or lack thereof in the videogame industry. We talked 
        about differently abled people and the products that allow them to play games like that guy that plays 
        with his feet or people with impaired fine motor abilities. Also deaf people and people with epilepsy
        and colorblind people have their own issues that must be catered to by the gaming industry.
        The main biases in videogame development stem mainly from making a game that only the creator
        would enjoy playing, which I would argue is what art is (making a piece for yourself that you alone can be
        proud of), but for many of the blockbuster games with no soul I think
        that they should try to reach as wide of an audience a possible. The art comment aside was not meant to say
        that accessibility features shouldn't be included just that the subject of your game needn't be dictated, 
        by what other's want it to be but it should be the game you want to make. In my opionon, games that 
        stem from an individual's perspective and direction are often better than megacorporate
        games (MGSV and all Souls Games vs like Assassins Creed or Horizon: Zero Dawn). Red Dead is the exception.
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 3: MDA for describing games</h4>
      <p>
        In this assignment we looked at a research paper attempting to to put as specific as possible
        definitions on the overarching mechanics and aesthetics of games. I thought this paper was super cool 
        and it was really interesting to think about how my favorite games appealed to these.
        I found that the aspects that were most consistent across my favorite games were Challenge, 
        Fellowship, and Fantasy. This is true for games like games like Dark Souls which are challenging\
        RPG's with multiplayer components. Also most MMO's because they immerse you in the world and 
        your character and force you to cooperate for certain rewards.
        <br><br>
        Later I droned on about one of my favorite games Elite Dangerous and how I would choose 
        to fix one mechanic to make certain elements of the game more rewarding. This assignment was 
        pretty interesting and thought provoking in how it made me view some of my favorite games and 
        how I would make a game that I would enjoy playing. 
      </p>

      <h4>Class: Feb 17</h4>
      <p>
        This class mainly focused on applying the MDA paper to the games we have played. We also 
        talked about how to make an educational game that is both interesting and can positively
        impact the views of our youths. I do not think I am going to take any large or remotely political
        stances in my game. Mainly because the game that I would be proud of would be largely free of 
        preaching except for maybe a little sidenote afterwards. I like animals so I will probably be 
        attempting to make a game about animals and their effects on the ecosystem around them. This 
        may segway into an end credits blurb/factoid about how these animals are trending in regards to
        climate change and thier endangerment rating. But I do not want to make a game explaining the dangers
        of unchecked climate change because, despite being a very real problem, I do not think that you 
        will reach people by telling them your views but rather presenting them with a reason to care 
        and then showing them that there is a real issue that affects what it is you care about. Hook the player 
        on something you care about and show them that it is being threatened rather than jump straight to 
        explaining your viewpoint because that makes for a terrribly unfun game.

      <h4>Class: Feb 8</h4>
      <p>
        Today we did introductions which was pretty fun. I liked the group I was placed in. At first it 
        was a little slow finding common likes and dislikes among our group but we eventually settled on 
        some Nintendo games we all liked. We did get smoked by some other groups in terms of quantity of
        answers but they did stuff like eat bread and breathe so I don't feel too bad. Individual activity 
        where we just talked about our favorite games. All in all pretty light first day I enjoyed getting to
        know a few classmates.
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 1: Reviewing Games from Different Genres</h4>
      <p>
        For this assignment we were tasked with finding 3 games and getting positive and negative feedback
        for each. I chose Rocket League, Dead Cells, and Counter Strike. At the time I was really into Dead
        Cells which is a pretty intense single player Roguelite 2D platformer dungeon crawler. The other two
        Are competetive multiplayer games. None of these games are very forgiving and each comes with a
        good amount of challenges to progress.
        <br><br>
        I think that I like all of these games because they are very challenging and very rewarding. I think
        that this is usually my favorite part of a game is overcoming challenges and the feeling of pride
        which follows. One of my other favorite games which didn't make the cut was Dark Souls 3 which is
        a very similar game to Dead Cells in it's difficulty and relative frequency of bossfights. The
        difficulty seems to be the prime draw in all of these games, with most of the difficulty in
        Counter Strike coming from attempting to cooperate with your self destructive teammates. Overall
        super satisfying games to play when you finally overcome those challenges and win.
      </p>

      <h4>Class: Feb 10</h4>
      <p>
        Today we just watched videos of little kids talking about what kind of games they like and 
        why they like them. The top picks were Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox. This was to be expected 
        but I would be lying if I said that I have not enjoyed playing all of these games before. Minecraft
        seemed to appeal to both the kids who enjoyed flexing their creative muscle along with the kids who
        just liked killing. That kid was my favorite because he told it like it is and just loves killin 
        virtual baddies. All of their game choices were pretty chill except it personally struck as a little
        wierd that the girl liked to play Roblox roleplay where it sounded like she was a stripper and because
        of this I think that kids should have access to multiplayer games where the experience is pretty user
        dependent. Meaning kids should not play in worlds created by adults that choose to spend their time on
        mmo's where childen congregate. Other than that though very informative and I liked all the kid's opinions
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 2: What makes up a game?</h4>
      <p>
        For this assignment we were tasked with analyzing and suggesting improvements for a simple pen and paper game and comparing two 
        dissimilar games. For my games I picked a rail tycoon boardgame called Ticket to Ride alongside Call of Duty Warzone. 
        I thought these would be fun to compare because they are wildly different in gameplay but they are rather similar 
        in the progression of the game. I made the statement that both games are driven by positioning and economy moreso than
        skill. Warzone is still highly skill dependent but a worse team can still beat a better team with better consumables 
        (bought with money), tactics, and position. In Ticket to Ride a good established main rail in a highly populated
        area can spell a late game snowball where the player no longer has to place roads and can just acquire already
        route cards which they have almost completed already given their position on the board.
        <br><br>
        For the game analysis section I wasn't exactly sure on the rules of the game so I proposed multiple
        rulechanges for each possible gamerules. That game could only be so fun though so there was not a huge room
        for improvement.
