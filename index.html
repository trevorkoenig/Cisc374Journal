        Today we did introductions which was pretty fun. I liked the group I was placed in. At first it 
        was a little slow finding common likes and dislikes among our group but we eventually settled on 
        some Nintendo games we all liked. We did get smoked by some other groups in terms of quantity of
        answers but they did stuff like eat bread and breathe so I don't feel too bad. Individual activity 
        where we just talked about our favorite games. All in all pretty light first day I enjoyed getting to
        know a few classmates.
