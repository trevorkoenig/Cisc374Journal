        Today we reviewed the kid's interviews and tried to compile a document which effectively summarized
        what their likes and dislikes were in general about videogames.

        Today we did introductions which was pretty fun. I liked the group I was placed in. At first it 
        was a little slow finding common likes and dislikes among our group but we eventually settled on 
        some Nintendo games we all liked. We did get smoked by some other groups in terms of quantity of
        answers but they did stuff like eat bread and breathe so I don't feel too bad. Individual activity 
        where we just talked about our favorite games. All in all pretty light first day I enjoyed getting to
        know a few classmates.
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 1: Reviewing Games from Different Genres</h4>
      <p>
        For this assignment we were tasked with finding 3 games and getting positive and negative feedback
        for each. I chose Rocket League, Dead Cells, and Counter Strike. At the time I was really into Dead
        Cells which is a pretty intense single player Roguelite 2D platformer dungeon crawler. The other two
        Are competetive multiplayer games. None of these games are very forgiving and each comes with a
        good amount of challenges to progress.
        <br><br>
        I think that I like all of these games because they are very challenging and very rewarding. I think
        that this is usually my favorite part of a game is overcoming challenges and the feeling of pride
        which follows. One of my other favorite games which didn't make the cut was Dark Souls 3 which is
        a very similar game to Dead Cells in it's difficulty and relative frequency of bossfights. The
        difficulty seems to be the prime draw in all of these games, with most of the difficulty in
        Counter Strike coming from attempting to cooperate with your self destructive teammates. Overall
        super satisfying games to play when you finally overcome those challenges and win.
      </p>

      <h4>Class: Feb 10</h4>
      <p>
        Today we just watched videos of little kids talking about what kind of games they like and 
        why they like them. The top picks were Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox. This was to be expected 
        but I would be lying if I said that I have not enjoyed playing all of these games before. Minecraft
        seemed to appeal to both the kids who enjoyed flexing their creative muscle along with the kids who
        just liked killing. That kid was my favorite because he told it like it is and just loves killin 
        virtual baddies. All of their game choices were pretty chill except it personally struck as a little
        wierd that the girl liked to play Roblox roleplay where it sounded like she was a stripper and because
        of this I think that kids should have access to multiplayer games where the experience is pretty user
        dependent. Meaning kids should not play in worlds created by adults that choose to spend their time on
        mmo's where childen congregate. Other than that though very informative and I liked all the kid's opinions
      </p>

      <h4>Homework 2: What makes up a game?</h4>
      <p>
        For this assignment we were tasked with analyzing and suggesting improvements for a simple pen and paper game and comparing two 
        dissimilar games. For my games I picked a rail tycoon boardgame called Ticket to Ride alongside Call of Duty Warzone. 
        I thought these would be fun to compare because they are wildly different in gameplay but they are rather similar 
        in the progression of the game. I made the statement that both games are driven by positioning and economy moreso than
        skill. Warzone is still highly skill dependent but a worse team can still beat a better team with better consumables 
        (bought with money), tactics, and position. In Ticket to Ride a good established main rail in a highly populated
        area can spell a late game snowball where the player no longer has to place roads and can just acquire already
        route cards which they have almost completed already given their position on the board.
        <br><br>
        For the game analysis section I wasn't exactly sure on the rules of the game so I proposed multiple
        rulechanges for each possible gamerules. That game could only be so fun though so there was not a huge room
        for improvement.
